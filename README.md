## 🌍 Addressing UN Sustainable Development Goals

This project directly contributes to multiple UN SDGs:

| SDG | Goal | Our Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ♻️ **SDG 12** | Responsible Consumption and Production | Creates an incentivized ecosystem for waste recovery and recycling. |
| 🏙️ **SDG 11** | Sustainable Cities and Communities | Enhances municipal waste management through community-driven reporting and collection. |
| 💰 **SDG 8** | Decent Work and Economic Growth | Creates new economic opportunities for waste collectors and rewards community contributions. |
| 🤝 **SDG 17** | Partnerships for the Goals | Leverages private tech (AI, Blockchain) to solve public environmental problems. |

---

## 🚨 The Problem

### Current State of Waste Management:

Traditional waste management systems face several critical challenges:

-   **⬇️ Low Engagement:** Lack of incentive for citizens to report illegal dumping or littering.
-   **🔍 Lack of Real-time Data:** Municipalities lack accurate, real-time data on waste location and type for efficient resource allocation.
-   **💰 High Operational Costs:** Inefficient routing and manual verification processes drive up collection costs.
-   **🔒 Lack of Transparency:** Centralized systems can lack public trust regarding waste fate and impact reporting.

### Real-World Impact:

Unreported Waste Pile: 100 kg of mixed plastic
Potential Time to Discovery: 3-5 days
Our Solution: Reported in <5 minutes with AI verification

This delay leads to environmental pollution, attracts pests, and creates public health hazards.

## 💡 Our Solution

### EchoWise-AI: An Incentivized Ecosystem

A full-stack, community-driven platform that leverages AI for verification and Web3 for gamified rewards, solving the engagement and transparency problems of waste management.

#### 🔬 How It Works

1.  **AI Verification:** Users report waste via an image; Google Gemini 3 AI instantly verifies the type and quantity.
2.  **Gamified Rewards:** Verified reports earn users ERC-20 compliant tokens, tracked on a transparent leaderboard.
3.  **Real-Time Tasks:** Reported waste immediately becomes a collection task on an interactive map.
4.  **Decentralized Access:** Web3Auth provides secure, multi-wallet authentication for all users.

#### 🎯 Key Innovation

EchoWise-AI is unique because it combines **Gemini AI's computer vision** for real-world environmental data capture with a **Web3 token economy** to directly incentivize positive community action, turning a civic duty into a rewarding activity.
